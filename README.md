# Introduction to Machine Learning Course Homework

The homeworks are divided between three diferent subjects that we studied in the course.
- **Homework 1**: Exploratory Data Analysis.
- **Homework 2**: Linear Regression Models.
- **Homework 3**: Linear And Nonlinear Classification Models.

In these three homeworks we used datasets from:
- **Gapminder**: In this article, we will analyze a data set containing information on Per Capita GDP, population size and life expectancy for different countries in different years. To perform the analysis, we used univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis techniques. Based on the result of the analysis of these variables, we want to find similarities and differences of the continents.

- **Medcal Costs**: The prediction of medical charges of a patient can help medical insurance companies to offer plans that overcome clients costs and increases the profit margins. To perform this predictions a simple approach is the use of linear regression model, that can be define via different approaches. On this work we going to discus the application of different approaches to define a linear regression model to predict the medical charges of a patient.
- **Predict Grant Applications**: The problem of verify if a grant application going to be accepted or not represent a challenge for universities around world, which are interested in create a solution to identify the students that going to be accepted by a grant program, resulting in more resources coming for the university. In this context, a possible solution is the application of classification models, that are able to predict the student result in the application program. Given that background, on this work we going to discuss the application of different types of classification models (linear and nonlinear) to predict grant application result.
